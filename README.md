# Portfolio Management and Risk Analysis

## Summer Project - Finance and Analytics Club
This repository contains the summer project completed as part of the Finance and Analytics Club's end-term evaluation. The project focuses on portfolio management and risk analysis using Python.

## Project Overview:
The project aims to implement various financial analysis techniques using Python and key libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. It covers fundamental concepts in finance, risk management, and portfolio optimization. Here's a brief overview of what each phase of the project entails:

### Phase Breakdown:
- Introduction to Python syntax and essential modules like NumPy and Pandas.
- Calculation of Sharpe ratio, annual return rate, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for a given list of stocks.
- Calculation of nth order moments and application of Jarque-Bera test on series of returns.
- Development of a reusable risk kit module with functions for common financial analyses.
- Construction of an efficient frontier for a portfolio of stocks and updating the risk kit.
- Implementation of Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) on a set of risky and safe assets, analyzing results such as Risky Value and Cushion History.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Python Fundamentals**: Basics of variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **NumPy**: Handling complex mathematical calculations and working with multidimensional arrays.
- **Pandas**: Manipulating and analyzing large datasets using DataFrames.
- **Financial Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, VaR, CVaR, moments, skewness, kurtosis, efficient frontier, and CPPI.

### Code Snippets:
Throughout the project, code snippets are provided to illustrate the implementation of various financial models and calculations. These snippets serve as practical examples of how theoretical concepts are applied in Python.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive overview of portfolio management techniques and risk analysis methodologies using Python. It equips members with practical skills in financial modeling and data analysis, essential for careers in finance and related fields.
